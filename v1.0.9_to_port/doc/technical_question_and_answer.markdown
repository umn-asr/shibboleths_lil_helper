Question
I've have apache and shib installed and configured for a particular IDP and out on a target server, and when I go to Shibboleth.sso/Login, I get "shibsp::ConfigurationException", whats wrong?

Answer:
One likely issue is that one of the files  referenced from shibboleth2.xml (i.e. attribute-map.xml), does not exist OR is not referenced as an absolute path in the case where shibboleth is not installed at the default location of /etc/shibboleth.


QUESTION:
When I hit something.com/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata on IIS I get:
Shibboleth Error
Shibboleth Extension not configured for web site (check ISAPI mappings in SP configuration).

how do I fix this?
ANSWER:

You probably just need to restart IIS and shibd.
